  summary:
    "My tech journey started when I was just 4â€”yep, I had a computer at that age, which was a big deal in my hometown! Fast forward to 2020, the year of Corona, while I was prepping for pre-engineering exams, I stumbled upon Python, and the rest is history. Now, I'm pursuing a BS in Software Engineering at [COMSATS Islamabad](https://www.comsats.edu.pk/), crafting websites with ReactJS, and leveling up to Next.js as a full-stack dev. Oh, and did I mention I've started sharing my tech musings on Instagram? You can find me at [@hasaandotdevðŸ’»âœ¨](https://www.instagram.com/hasaandotdev).",
